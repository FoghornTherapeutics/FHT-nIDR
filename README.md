# Motivations

The Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) is a method to combine combining replicates to only get the highly reproducible peaks and consistency between replicates in high-throughput experiments.  One way to assess concordance of peak calls between replicates is to implement a statistical procedure. A popular method is the IDR framework developed by Qunhua Li and Peter Bickelâ€™s group. It compares a pair of ranked lists of regions/peaks and assigns values that reflect its reproducibility. The core IDR R package can be downloaded from the [IDR download page](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/idr/index.html).

This method can only compare a pair of repicates. When you have n replicates, you the have to compare $\binom{N}{2}$ pair of replicates. If N=4, you then have to compare by hand 6 pair of replicates. We propose another method to highlight the most significant peaks and consitency between replicates.
