# Motivations

The Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) is a method to combine combining replicates to only get the highly reproducible peaks and consistency between replicates in high-throughput experiments.  One way to assess concordance of peak calls between replicates is to implement a statistical procedure. A popular method is the IDR framework developed by Qunhua Li and Peter Bickelâ€™s group. It compares a pair of ranked lists of regions/peaks and assigns values that reflect its reproducibility. The core IDR R package can be downloaded from the [IDR download page](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/idr/index.html).

This method can only compare a pair of repicates. When you have n replicates, you the have to compare $\binom{N}{2}$ pair of replicates. If N=4, you then have to compare by hand 6 pair of replicates. We propose another method to highlight the most significant peaks and consitency between replicates with all the replicates at once. 


# Data

The standard pipeline is ran on publicly available data from paper "[Chromatin accessibility underlies synthetic lethality of SWI/SNF subunits in ARID1A-mutant cancers](https://elifesciences.org/articles/30506#content)" looking for potential PD markers as well as what an ATAC-seq profile looks like. This paper has ATACseq results of ARID1A-/- cancers with ARID1B KD.

# FHT-nIDR data flow

In this example, we compare the reproducibility between 3 replicates called A1, A2 and A3.  


**Step 1**: Combine and merge three replicates peak id, peak origin and logFC on the same narrowPeak file. For this step, we use bedtools merge to merge the peaks. In consequence, we can have several logFC from the same replicate. <br/>
**Step 2**: Reformat bed file with a logFC per replicate and by peak id. If there is logFC from a replicate, the value is 0. When there are several logFC from the same replicates, we compute the average between them. <br/>
**Step 3**: Generate a shuffled distribution of the logFC over the given list of peak ID for each replicate.<br/>
**Step 4**: Compute the min percent rank of the shuffled distribution for each peak over the three replicates. In other words, we compute the percent rank of each replicates, i.e., we have three percent rank for each replicate. Then we only keep the minimum of the percent rank for each peak id. <br/>
**Step 5**: Compute the ECDF and select the min percentage rank that corresponds to keeping above 90% of the reads.  In this example, the min percent rank is around 0.53. <br/>
**Step 6**: Filter all peak id that have a min percent rank lower than the selected threshold from the null distribution. <br/>
**Step 7**: Plot the ECDF of the min percent rank of the true logFC (red) and the null distribution (blue) with the threshold (green) to compare them. We expect to to see the null distribution above the real one and the threshold around where they have the bggest discreapancy. <br/>
